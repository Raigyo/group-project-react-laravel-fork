# Becode - JepsenBrite

![Becode logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raigyo/react-character-manager/master/img/becode-logo.png)

*April 2019*

> ðŸ”¨ The job was to take the [application](https://github.com/PaulineRoppe/jepsenbrite) of another group and while fixing some minor bugs, adding new features. Obviously we had to keep the design of the original owner. You can check the original application on this [link](https://jepsen-brite.herokuapp.com/).

The application is still a CRUD Application to manage events online. If you want to know how the new version looks like check it out [here](https://jepsen-brite-v2.herokuapp.com/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You'll need [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to download and install all the dependencies.

You need a PostgreSQL database, if you already have one, you can put your credentials in the .env file in the DB_... section.  If you do not have one, you can use [docker](https://www.docker.com/). The docker-compose.yml is given in the root directory.

### Installing

To get a development env running, install all the dependencies with:
```cmd
composer install && npm install
```
Don't forget to edit your .env file. If you do not have one:
```cmd
cp .env.example .env
``` 
And modify your credentials.
Then generate your jwt key and your app key
```cmd
php artisan key:generate
php artisan jwt:secret
```

If you don't have a PostgreSQL you can start the docker-compose.yml file is included up in the root directory
```cmd
docker-compose up
```
To start your PHP server use the command (*by default the server will start on localhost:8000*):
```cmd
php artisan serve
```
You can specify a port by using 
```cmd
php artisan serve --port=8080
```
Or you can simply run the launchscript.sh with:
```cmd
./launchscript.sh
```
If it doesn't work, it probably means you have to set the right to execute it.
```cmd
sudo chmod +x launchscript.sh
```

## Deployment

The project is ready to deploy on heroku, just push this repo to your herokuapp repository.
Add you addon for the database with the following :
```cmd
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```
Don't forget to edit the configs with:
 * APP_ENV  =  production
 * APP_KEY
 * APP_URL = your url
 * DB_CONNECTION = heroku
 * JWT_SECRET
 * MAIL_PASSWORD
 * MAIL_USERNAME

 And finally run in the console of your heroku app:
 ```cmd
 php artisan migrate:fresh
 ```
to set your database.

There is a scheduler for email notification when someone is wanting to attend to an event.
To activate it do not forget to also use :
```
heroku ps:scale web=1
php artisan schedule:daemon
```
